# Bar
A status bar made in quickshell for niri.

To use, clone it into `~/.config/quickshell`:
```bash
cd ~/.config/quickshell
git clone https://github.com/Tsunami014/bar
```

You can put this line in some config.kdl file in niri's config to make it run on startup:
```bash
spawn-at-startup "quickshell" "-c" "bar" "-n"
```
